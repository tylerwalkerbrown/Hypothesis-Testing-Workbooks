# Hypothesis Testing


 In both cases we reject the null because the p vals are < 5 showing low probability of H0 being correct:

The Survived t-test p-value of 1.206788310e ( very small number) indicates that the mean age of individuals who survived is significantly different from 30 at the 95% confidence level.
The Died t-test p-value of 0.0017 indicates that the mean age of individuals who died is significantly different from 30 at the 95% confidence level.
